      The 4th Corporate War's over and the big dogs have retreated to their corners to lick their
      wounds. That leaves everyone else to fend for themselves in a shattered world. And that's just
      fine. 'cause you've got interface plugs in your wrists, metal in your limbs, and chips in your
      skull. You're wired in, loaded with chrome, and ready to take it to the Edge.

      There's a world full of opportunities out there. Maybe this time you can do more than save
      yourself. Maybe.
